                sofa_.  GERALD _in a chair_.]</p>
                <i class="material-icons">person</i>
                <h6 class="name LORDILLINGWORTH">LORD ILLINGWORTH.</h6><p class="speech">Thoroughly sensible woman, your mother, Gerald.  I
knew she would come round in the end.</p>
<i class="material-icons">person</i>
<h6 class="name GERALD">GERALD.</h6> <p class="speech">My mother is awfully conscientious, Lord Illingworth, and I know
she doesn’t think I am educated enough to be your secretary.  She is
perfectly right, too.  I was fearfully idle when I was at school, and I
couldn’t pass an examination now to save my life.</p>

<h6 class="name LORDILLINGWORTH">LORD ILLINGWORTH.</h6> <p class="speech">My dear Gerald, examinations are of no value
whatsoever.  If a man is a gentleman, he knows quite enough, and if he is
not a gentleman, whatever he knows is bad for him.</p>
<h6 class="name GERALD">GERALD.</h6> <p class="speech">But I am so ignorant of the world, Lord Illingworth.</p>
<h6 class="name LORDILLINGWORTH">LORD ILLINGWORTH.</h6> <p class="speech">Don’t be afraid, Gerald.  Remember that you’ve got on
your side the most wonderful thing in the world—youth!  There is nothing
like youth.  The middle-aged are mortgaged to Life.  The old are in
life’s lumber-room.  But youth is the Lord of Life.  Youth has a kingdom
waiting for it.  Every one is born a king, and most people die in exile,
like most kings.  To win back my youth, Gerald, there is nothing I
wouldn’t do—except take exercise, get up early, or be a useful member of
the community.</p>
<h6 class="name GERALD">GERALD.</h6> <p class="speech">But you don’t call yourself old, Lord Illingworth?</p>
<h6 class="name LORDILLINGWORTH">LORD ILLINGWORTH.</h6> <p class="speech">I am old enough to be your father, Gerald.</p>
<h6 class="name GERALD">GERALD.</h6> <p class="speech">I don’t remember my father; he died years ago.</p>
<h6 class="name LORDILLINGWORTH">LORD ILLINGWORTH.</h6> <p class="speech">So Lady Hunstanton told me.</p>
<h6>GERALD.</h6> <p class="speech">It is very curious, my mother never talks to me about my father.
I sometimes think she must have married beneath her.</p>
<h6 class="name LORDILLINGWORTH">LORD ILLINGWORTH.</h6>  <p class="stage-direction">[_Winces slightly_.] [_Goes over and puts
his hand on_ GERALD’S _shoulder_.]</p> <p class="speech" >You have missed not having a father,
I suppose, Gerald? </p>
<h6 class="name GERALD">GERALD.</h6><p class="speech"> Oh, no; my mother has been so good to me.  No one ever had such
a mother as I have had.</p>
<h6 class="name LORDILLINGWORTH">LORD ILLINGWORTH.</h6><p class="speech"> I am quite sure of that.  Still I should imagine that
most mothers don’t quite understand their sons.  Don’t realise, I mean,
that a son has ambitions, a desire to see life, to make himself a name.
After all, Gerald, you couldn’t be expected to pass all your life in such
a hole as Wrockley, could you?</p>
<h6 class="name GERALD">GERALD.</h6> <p class="speech">Oh, no!  It would be dreadful!</p>
<h6 class="name LORDILLINGWORTH">LORD ILLINGWORTH.</h6> <p class="speech">A mother’s love is very touching, of course, but it is
often curiously selfish.  I mean, there is a good deal of selfishness in
it.</p>
<h6 class="name GERALD">GERALD.</h6> <p class="stage-direction">[_Slowly_.]</p> <p class="speech">I suppose there is.</p>
<h6 class="name LORDILLINGWORTH">LORD ILLINGWORTH.</h6> <p class="speech">Your mother is a thoroughly good woman.  But good
women have such limited views of life, their horizon is so small, their
interests are so petty, aren’t they?</p>
<h6 class="name GERALD">GERALD.</h6> <p class="speech">They are awfully interested, certainly, in things we don’t care
much about.</p>
<h6 class="name LORDILLINGWORTH">LORD ILLINGWORTH.</h6> <p class="speech">I suppose your mother is very religious, and that sort
of thing.</p>
<i class="material-icons">person</i>
<h6 class="name MRS_ARBUTHNOT">MRS. ARBUTHNOT.</h6>  I should be sorry to follow Lord Illingworth in any of
his opinions.
<h6 class="name LORDILLINGWORTH">LORD ILLINGWORTH.</h6> <p class="speech"> Yes; I am always astonishing myself.  It is the only
    thing that makes life worth living.</p>
<h6 class="name MRS_ARBUTHNOT">MRS. ARBUTHNOT.</h6>  I do not, Lady Hunstanton.  I think there are many
things women should never forgive.
