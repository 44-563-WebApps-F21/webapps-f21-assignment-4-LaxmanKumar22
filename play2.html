            hope I shan’t.  It would be most inconvenient.  Women love us for our
            defects.  If we have enough of them, they will forgive us everything,
            even our gigantic intellects.</p>

<h6 class="name GERALD">GERALD.</h6> <p class="speech">Mother, how changeable you are!  You don’t seem to know your own
    mind for a single moment.  An hour and a half ago in the Drawing-room you
    agreed to the whole thing; now you turn round and make objections, and
    try to force me to give up my one chance in life.  Yes, my one chance.
    You don’t suppose that men like Lord Illingworth are to be found every
    day, do you, mother?  It is very strange that when I have had such a
    wonderful piece of good luck, the one person to put difficulties in my
    way should be my own mother.  Besides, you know, mother, I love Hester
    Worsley.  Who could help loving her?  I love her more than I have ever
    told you, far more.  And if I had a position, if I had prospects, I
    could—I could ask her to—Don’t you understand now, mother, what it means
    to me to be Lord Illingworth’s secretary?  To start like that is to find
    a career ready for one—before one—waiting for one.  If I were Lord
    Illingworth’s secretary I could ask Hester to be my wife.  As a wretched
    bank clerk with a hundred a year it would be an impertinence.</p>
    <h6 class="name GERALD">GERALD.</h6> <p class="speech">I fear you need have no hopes of Miss Worsley.  I know
        her views on life.  She has just told them to me.</p>Then I have my ambition left, at any rate.  That is something—I
        am glad I have that!  You have always tried to crush my ambition,
        mother—haven’t you?  You have told me that the world is a wicked place,
        that success is not worth having, that society is shallow, and all that
        sort of thing—well, I don’t believe it, mother.  I think the world must
        be delightful.  I think society must be exquisite.  I think success is a
        thing worth having.  You have been wrong in all that you taught me,
        mother, quite wrong.  Lord Illingworth is a successful man.  He is a
        fashionable man.  He is a man who lives in the world and for it.  Well, I
        would give anything to be just like Lord Illingworth.</p>x
